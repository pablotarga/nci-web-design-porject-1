	<h4>Family Reunion</h4>
	<p>
	The wizard Jalen gazed admiringly at the colourful wisps of smoke that lingered in the air before him. With a simple flick of his wrist he could make them, twirl and change colour or even weave together to form anything from soaring birds to a falling snowflake.  His gave shifted and the wisps evaporated into nothingness. 12.45pm she was late, again, no less than he'd come to expect, after all he'd known her all his life.</p>
	<p>When they were young, people had often assumed they were twins. Jalen was exceedingly thankful that this was no longer the case. He knew well that she shared his gratefulness. They had always had very different and distinct personalities, even as children and while they may have looked somewhat similar as infants that had steadily faded through the course of adolescence.
	 He had been so absorbed in his own thoughts Jalen almost failed to notice her striding into view. A grin spread across his face, she always strutted, couldn't help it. Her walk seemed to announce to the world “Hey I'm stubborn, vain and wild but with a heart of gold, if you don't like it well tough”. Jalen eyed her appreciatively, she was the good looking one, he knew he wasn't ugly by any means, but while his was a quirky handsomeness where he scrubs up well, she was a true beauty whose athletic body could not be concealed by the masculine clothes she always wore when traveling.</p>
	<p> “You're late again Nyx”. She grinned at him mischievously, “What are baby sisters for if not to keep their big brother's waiting”. “Baby sister, since when have you ever acted like the younger sibling?” Jalen exclaims in mock astonishment. “When it suits me of course” Nyx said with a composed expression that was unreadable. Jalen knew he was probably the only person alive that would notice the cheeky glint that twinkled in her eyes. They had never conformed to the stereotypical brother sister relationship; she had always been the more outgoing, stronger and aggressive individual. Despite the fact that he was several inches taller than her, her athletic, toned figure was a stark contrast to his lean sinewy frame. She was the dominant big sister, even if she was a year younger than him. He never resented her for any of it though, they had their share of sibling spats but she had always looked out for him and he loved her for it.</p>
	<p>“So sis what's new with you?” he asked casually. Her face darkened instantly as she slumped into the chair opposite him . She removed a crumpled piece of paper from her pocket and tossed it across the table to . “What's this?” he asks quizzically. “Check it out for yourself” she muttered with feigned indifference. He could see a vein in her neck throb as she clenched her jaw, and decided it was best to look at it before pressing any further. The paper looked like it had been balled up an crushed in someone's fist. He unfolded it slowly and smoothed it out on the table in front of him. It was actually a photograph of a slightly overweight middle aged man wearing expensive robes and an elaborate crown on his head. He was grinning madeley and giving the camera an enthusiastic thumbs-up. Scrawled across the photo was “Dear Nyx, Thanks so much for your loyal service King Richard X”.</p>
	<p> “What the hell?” Jalen scratches his  head his head in confusion and stared at Nyx questioningly. “There not renewing my contract, it seems that my services are no longer required. Apparently thanks to my unwavering heroism there is a distinct lack of evil deeds and curses to foil, princes/princesses to be rescued and or other general magical disasters or catastrophes for me to prevent. Hence I have been relieved of my duties.  “You've been fired”  Jalen spluttered. “SO it would seem” Nyx replied irately.</p>
	<p> Jalen gazed at his sister in utter astonishment. Then a smile spread across his face “Ah well with your heroic expertise, you'll find a new steady employer in no time at all, no worries”. “Actually I've already tried. I was told in no uncertain terms that I am overqualified”. “Well that's only one persons opinion, try, try again as they say Jalen declares encouragingly. “It was a few more than one person if you must know” Nyx muttered grumpily. “EH exactly how many are we talking” jalen replied. “37” “What your kidding no way” “Yes well, it seems I am unemployable” Nyx retorted in a rather irritated tone.</p>
	<p>Jalen gazes at Nyx thoughtfully, how could they do this to her, she was the bravest most valient and skilled hero in the kingdom or in many others for that matter. Granted she didn't pledge loyalty to any one person, it just wasn't her style. She was a free spirit unwilling to bind herself to anyone indefinitely. A freelance hero one might call her, regardless of this she would be bought by knowone. She came to the call of of anyone who asked, but would only help those whose cause was just. Jalen sniggered to himself,
many a corrupt evildoer had offered Xyx bountiful sums in exchange for her assistance in carrying out their depraved exploits and all had barely lived to regret it.</p>
<p>“Eh Jalen”, Nyx snapped her fingers sharpely. He had that dazed stupid grin on his face that always appeared when he was contemplating something amusing, or rather that he thought was amusing. “Hey bro” she smacked him gently upside the back of the head. “What oh sorry Nyx” he said, his shoulders and head drooping in an apologetic fashion. “So what are you planning to do now? Oh I know!” jalen announced enthusiastically . “You should go on a Holiday”.
