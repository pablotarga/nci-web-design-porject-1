### Guidelines

![Layout guidelines](https://github.com/pablotarga/nci-web-design-project-1/blob/dev/mocks/images/Screenshot%202019-11-17%20at%2016.19.48.png)

All pages have footer with social links, see example page

Styled capitals for some text - Kev research this

Font is currently Lato (Helvetica is not free)

All content in a card - layout done in a surrounding element e.g. a div, with flex properties etc. (for columns etc)

No bordered elements inside card

Research fantasy/celtic border for all cards (Kev)

Use modals for chapter preview and for short story

Use same layout for author and book pages (photo on one side, etc. see wireframes)

Use same countdown on book page and home page (dramatic, with seconds?)
