      <h4>The Beginning</h4>
	<p>Mansion House, Carpathian Mountains.... </p>
	<p>
	In a towering mansion in the mountains of eastern Europe a man sits in his lavish study watching a news
	report. He is a tall man 6.1 and quite muscular, he is wearing a expensive yet reserved black suit. Many
	would call him handsome with his tanned, unlined face, hooked nose and darks brown almost black eyes.
	His messy short black hair perfectly highlighting his best features, yes he would be called very handsome
	but for the frown marring his face as he watches the report. His hands are constantly clenching and
	unclenching in agitation, they are large and callused but also elegantly manicured. His appearance showed
	a man who was rich yet humble, wild yet cultured and also unafraid to get his hands dirty when needed,
	and this is exactly how he wanted to be seen.</p>

	<p >The news report is the latest on the "Adolescent Mutations" that's what their calling it now. A scientist is
	saying they still don't have a definite reason to why different people are being effected so differently.
	Pictures are shown of a girl with reddish scales on her arms and elongated teeth, a boy with clawed
	hands and feathers growing on his legs and a little girl with glowing green eyes with pointed ears and
	teeth. The reporter finished by saying that although they have not found a way to stop the mutation, that
	know one to date has had their health negatively effected, so there is no reason to panic. The man sights
	and murmurs "At least they're being objective".</p>
	<p>He then looks at the paper on the desk and his frown
	turns into a full blown scowl. The headline reads "Alien Invasion Imminent as Mutagenic Pathogen
	Spreads". Half way through the article he is so incensed that he slams a clawed and scaled hand down on
	the desk. He starts to pace the whole time muttering curses under his breath half in Russian and half in
	Turkish, his hand clenched so tight that blood started to drip through his fingers. Anyone understanding
	him would first be impressed by his perfect pronunciation of both languages, and then turn bright red over
	the implications of what was said about the authors paternity, dietary habits and sexual proclivity. After a
	few minutes he had calmed down somewhat, unclenched his hand and watched as the claws and scales
	receded and finally the gouges in his palm sealed and disappeared. Wiping away the excess blood with a
	hanky he sat back down at his desk, pointedly ignoring the paper. He needed to do something before
	things escalated. But he couldn't do it alone, he needed allies. He thought of all the people he knew who
	could conceivably help him, people he liked or who liked him, people who owed him favours, people he
	had worked with before, and people who had the most power and authority. He finally settled on five
	names to begin with. He sat back to write five separate letters to five very different people.</p>
	<p>After an hour he was finished and sealed each letter with his ring imprinted in wax. The crest of a crouching dragon was
	plain on each letter and they glowed briefly after the letter was closed. He rose to his feet picking up the
	five letters and walked towards the fire, with a gesture the flames turned black. He dropped the letters into
	the flames, but the did not burn. Instead they started to glow brightly. He then gestured at the flames again
	this time with both hands. The fire rose up for a few seconds and there was whooshing sound and the
	letters were gone, while five balls of light shot out of the chimney and across the night sky. They were
	like shooting stars, one headed north, two headed south, one east and one west. He then headed for the
	door out onto the balcony that gave a breathtaking view of the forested valley below. He stayed out there
	a long time staring up at the brilliant night sky, thinking about the past, and many possible futures.</p>

	<p>Three days latter at dusk he looked out over the forest again waiting for his guests to arrive, the sky a
	sight of yellow, pink and red. He was pulled out of his thoughts by a loud shriek. Glancing upwards he
	finally saw her, miles up in the air, a great golden eagle. Then she closed her wings and dived at a truly

	breakneck speed. What seemed like an inch from the canopy she finally opened her three metre long
	wings and levelled off. Just before she reached the balcony, she started to glow and in an instant the eagle
	was gone and in her place was a strikingly beautiful woman with long blond hair and ice blue eyes
	wearing shining silver armour and having enormous golden brown wings. As she landed her wings
	receded and her armour became a sharp grey power suit. The only thing the same was the amulet around
	her neck. A circle with eight spiked tridents bisecting out from it. "Greetings my friend" she said in a firm
clear voice "What is the Emergency?"
