            <em><strong>PROTECTORS OF THE NORTH</strong></em>
            <br>
            <br> an epic fantasy novel in the style of Brandon Sanderson and Mercedes Lackey!
        </p>
        <p>
            He's a fiendish coffee-fuelled assassin who must take medication to keep him sane. She's a hard-bitten motormouth college professor from a secret island of warrior women. Together, they fight dragons!
        </p>
        <p> 
           The Draconic Empire has been the world's uncontested great power for a thousand years. Humans are a downtrodden minority, save for a privileged few. When one of those few, Diana the Scholar, stumbles over a prophecy foretelling the coming of a rebel prince who'll lead to the empire's downfall, she's forced to go on the run -- in the company of Assassin-Bob, an unstable, over-caffeinated assassin whose track record lies more in killing people than keeping them alive.
        </p>
        <p>   
           The empire will pursue them to the ends of the earth and beyond. Because Diana isn't just the prophecy's discoverer: she's the only woman alive who knows how to properly read it -- and to whom it refers.

                <p id="chapter-text">Not the first time she'd woken with her body bearing evidence of injuries she didn't remember receiving. Maybe the third, counting what happened that terrible winter in Darivantium. She lay still on -- a straw pallet, she thought, and beneath it the dank chill of stone -- and took stock. Her head, dulled and a little sore. A shivery ache in her muscles, like the aftermath of fever. Her belly cramped and hollow: she'd been a day at least without eating, then, likely more. Mouth dry, but not so dry that all she could think of was thirst. More definite pain in her ribs -- bruises, most likely, maybe from a beating. Probably a beating: cold metal restrained her wrists, and a sharp pain like broken bones twisted her left hand...</p>
